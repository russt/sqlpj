DISTRIBUTION:

o add INSTALL instructions
o package modules into one file (like I did for commitd)
o figure out what license header to use
o write codegen script to create source dist.
o check it in to perl.org.  get some help on creating the driver part.

LOCAL TOOLS:

o add sqlpj to my local tools distribution:
  -does toolsBuild work with multiple projects?
  -Is there a way to portably pack up JDBC and Jave inline modules?

MINOR:

o push setting of pathSeparator down into pkgconfig object (currently in main).
o should I be cleaning up the "_Inline" dir when I exit?

PROCESS:
o need to build regression test suite against an embedded db - derby or hsql perhaps?

MISSING FEATURES:

o FEATURE: diagnostics when jdbc connection fails
o FEATURE: diagnostics when JDBC.pm or Inline::Java packages are unavailable
o FEATURE: reconnect when disconnected after idle period (workaround: use db)
o FEATURE: add dump/restore of database or tables in portable XML format.
o FEATURE: add index creation for show create [table] command.
o FEATURE: ORACLE SUPPORT: test all features against ORACLE instance
