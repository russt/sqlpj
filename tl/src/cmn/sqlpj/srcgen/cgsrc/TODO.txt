NOTES, 2/11/13

o bug in large retrievals - e.g., failed when dumping ec_propery which has 4.8M records,
  even with boosted java memory. also, double scan for column size is bad news for large dumps.
o add option to eliminate or improve performance of column-sizes estimation setMaxColumnSizes().
  use grep or map?  NOTE: this does not happen for xml display
o implement csv feature!

-----------------
Some feature ideas, 2/8/13

o for sql syntax errors, use the line/column numbers to generate a visual error message.
                                                         like this ^
  Note, not all engines return line number/column info - derbydb does, mysql does not.
-----------------
DISTRIBUTION TODO:

o add INSTALL instructions
o package modules into one file (like I did for commitd)
o figure out what license header to use
o write codegen script to create source dist.
o check it in to perl.org.  get some help on creating the driver part.

LOCAL TOOLS:

o add sqlpj to my local tools distribution:
  -does toolsBuild work with multiple projects?
  -Is there a way to portably pack up JDBC and Jave inline modules?

MINOR:

o push setting of pathSeparator down into pkgconfig object (currently in main).
o should I be cleaning up the "_Inline" dir when I exit?

PROCESS:
o need to build regression test suite against an embedded db - derby or hsql perhaps?

MISSING FEATURES:

o FEATURE: diagnostics when jdbc connection fails
o FEATURE: diagnostics when JDBC.pm or Inline::Java packages are unavailable
o FEATURE: reconnect when disconnected after idle period (workaround: use db)
o FEATURE: add dump/restore of database or tables in portable XML format.
o FEATURE: add index creation for show create [table] command.
o FEATURE: ORACLE SUPPORT: test all features against ORACLE instance

COMPLETED FEATURES:
o add echo command
  [DONE 2/9/13]
o added schema command, -e commands no longer limited to sql
  [DONE 2/9/13]
o set prompt to be the database connection instead of "sqlpj>" i.e.,  mysql>, derbydb>, ora>, firebird>, etc.
  [DONE 2/9/13]
o FEATURE: arguments to set jdbc parameter, or -props <file> to read from a property file
  [DONE 5/16/07 IN=41191]
o FEATURE: add -V (version) arg.
  [DONE 5/16/07 IN=41191]
o FEATURE: show create [table] - generate sql to create a table, including indices
  [DONE 5/7/07 IN=41186]
o FEATURE: show conn[ection] - show jdbc connection properties, including product & version
  [DONE 5/5/07 IN=41181]
o FEATURE: intercept the "use" command, and retrieve the metadata for new database.
  [DONE 5/5/07 IN=41181]
o FEATURE: show db - show db name
  [DONE 5/5/07 IN=41181]
